## Setup
For this program to work, you will need a C/C++ compiler. We recommend [_MinGW_](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), which is the one we used. Keep your eyes on the said architeture, 32-bits version is needed.
Install the compiler on the official page, run the executable, and download via MingGW Installation Manager the C compatibility.
Then, you just need to open CMD/PowerShell, and type "mingw32-make run" on the downloaded repository root file.

## Usage
WASD to walk, Spacebar to interact.

Walk up to the NPC, press Space to interact, defeat it in battle mode, reach the final object.
